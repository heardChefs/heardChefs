- 👋 Ayo! You may call me "heardChef" of @heardChefs
- 👀 teel deer: I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathies...
- 🌱 I’m currently practicing prompt engineering, because that's [how you get to Carnegie Hall](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Explore/Articles/2020/04/10/The-Joke)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... try me?
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - Interested parties may request a meeting at https://calendly.com/heardChef/
  - Your host requests that you kindly do them the courtesy of beginning the call with your camera on, and your microphone off
  - You may request an accomodation to that request in the description of the calendly booking, which be accomodated at heardChef's discretion.  Perseverance is your only resort in the event of a declined appointment, I'm afraid.  This isn't the only thing I do with my time.
- 😄 Pronouns: For now, let's go with "they/them/you" to you, Rando Calrissian.
- ⚡ Fun facts:
  - I'm an inventor on a patent in multiple international regions
  - I am really into advanced breathwork, and will happily provide resources, should you manage to reach me.
  - I know how to make a _kick. ass._ caprese salad.

## The Bottom Line
> Manners Maketh Man

* Act accordingly, chef, and respect the hustle.
* You're free to do anything you like with the publicly visible compositions contained here, within the bounds associated licenses (and specific files may have their own, tighter licensing constraints, so look alive), and their constraints and freedoms.
* Some of my work will be free to view, use, adapt, and commercialize, on the condition that I am given credit, and _my calendly link is provided in your acknoweldgement of my contributions to your continuation of the work I have started here._

I haven't decided if I'm open to consulting or employment yet, but feel free to take a run at me, but don't bother unless you already have a specific number and title in mind.

I'm doing this for my kids, dog.  Have some respect, and be polite.

** A Caveat to those who have never cooked: ** 
heardChefs/heardChefs is very passionate about respecting social contracts.  Should you violate the guidelines of set forth in the introduction to my github profile or any of the work's related license agreement, you may find yourself encountering more friction than you had been inspected.  [heardChefs](https://github.com/heardChefs) is keeping score, and this is being done methodically, deliberately, often slowly, and while we aspire to inspire and contribute to society, we invite you to consider the follow quote from Frank Herbert's "Dune":

“When strangers meet, great allowances should be made for differences in custom and training.” - Frank Herbert, (c) 1965

If you've never cooked, I mean actually cooked, it's OK.  Take a breath, then another, and if you still want to attempt a conversation, indicate in the appointment request description that you haven't cooked, but you'd like to learn.  This will signal to me that you are untrained, and accomodations will be required, which I am happy to provide, to an extent.
